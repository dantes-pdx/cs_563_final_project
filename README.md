# cs_563_final_project

HW 3 was used as a base file setup with incremental changes added to accomplish its
final deployment. Many of the features were reworked to fix rendering or logical bugs.
I used the bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) to look for interesting components and
included some features to the website. Most notably the Carousel and jumbotron in the achievements and work history sections. Addionally, I used bootstrap as a general reference
for my projects HTML code for features. Other websites I used were stack overflow, google searchs and some class code references.

I tried my best to get this website to work as anticipated with some theme and styling changes
done on the fly as I searched new interesting features. I don't presume its a perfect website but it look just the way I want it to from an artistic point of view. Some of the
coding may look redundant this is due to me debugging and restyling as best I could.
To view the page locally simply download all files in a directory then open the index.html
file in a browser and the local website landing page will render. For the live version the
website viewers can visit:
